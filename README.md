#  Mammography Classification with Optimized Deep_Learning

A modular and production ready deep learning framework for classifying breast abnormalities using mammographic imaging. 

This project leverages tailored CNN architectures and strategic data augmentation to enhance diagnostic accuracy on the MIAS dataset.

---

##  Overview

This repository implements and compares several pretrained deep learning models on the [MIAS](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/mias-mammography-dataset) mammography dataset, focusing on improved generalization through:

- Smart data augmentation
- Label balancing with optional inclusion of normal tissue
- Freezing pre-trained convolutional backbones
- Modular training and evaluation pipeline
